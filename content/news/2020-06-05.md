We’re excited to announce our latest initiative to help us amplify the value of open source processor IP – OpenHWTV. It’s a series of online events that look at the barriers to adoption of opensource IP and in each episode, we delve a little deeper into different areas with help from our 45+ members.

In the first episode, which airs on **18th June @ 11am EST**, we look at the importance of verification with guest presenters from Imperas, a leader in virtual platforms and high-performance software simulation and Metrics, the first true cloud-based platformfor ASIC and complex FPGA design verification. They will be highlighting the open source CORE-V processor IP design verification plan using state of the art flows andSystemVerilog UVM testbenches, with encapsulated Imperas RISC-V reference model, coverage based flow, and Metrics flexible cloud based environment.

Panellists for the live Q&A session in this episode include the Co-Chairs of the OpenHW verification task group (Futurewei and SiliconLabs).
